## Project description

A web app that allows users to register, login, and find other users based on their **preferences**. A simple **chat system** was implemented as well.
The goal of the project was to learn to design and develop RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js. The project was developed in a team of 5 people and Scrum was adopted as an agile workflow methodology.
Pair programming was also adopted as a development technique since it was the first time working with Node.js and REST for some of the team members.
