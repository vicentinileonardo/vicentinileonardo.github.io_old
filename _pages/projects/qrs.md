## Project description

**Hybrid recommendation system** leveraging a linear combination of Expanded-Item-Item Collaborative Filtering and Compact Item-Item Collaborative Filtering based on query result cardinality.

## Team and role

Team size: 2 people

+ I was responsible for the implementation of the precursor of the generic Item-Item Collaborative Filtering algorithm and the **Compact Item-Item Collaborative Filtering** algorithm. <br>
+ I proposed and integrated the **evaluation metrics** used throughout the project. <br>
+ I implemented several other components, following other approaches, such as a **Content-based** algorithm, which did not satisfied our baseline requirements. <br>
+ I proposed and implemented the **linear combination** based on query result cardinality of the two best algorithms. <br>
+ Given my previous experience with **data visualization**, I created the visualizations of the results for the report, along with the contribution to the redaction of the report itself.
