## Project description

A digital watermarking tool developed for the **"Catch the Mark" competition** of the Multimedia Data Security graduate course at the University of Trento. <br>
The implementation is based on various research papers and leverages **Discrete Wavelet Transform** and **Singular Value Decomposition**. <br>
The repository contains code for embedding, detecting, and attacking watermarked images. <br>
Overall, the embedding strategy was evaluated as interesting and effective. <br>
**Azure IaaS** (VM with configured Python venv), Google Colab (Jupyter notebooks) and local machines were exploited for the parallelization of the attack phase.

## Team and role

Team size: 4 people

+ I was responsible for the implementation of the **embedding** and **detection** algorithm along with another team member. <br>
+ I **proposed** and **set up** simple but effective cloud services for the attack phase. <br>
+ Given my previous experience with Python and its main libraries, I took the lead for the **supervision** of the project and the **coordination** of the team.
+ Since our backgrounds were pretty different, we tried to **leverage** the most of each other's skills and knowledge, from telecommunications to software engineering and cybersecurity. <br>
