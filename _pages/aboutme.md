# Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities that stimulate my mind. I love **discovering new things** and **broadening my knowledge**.
Here are a few of my current hobbies:

## Side Projects 🏗

I like to work on side projects to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Usually, the ideas come from my interests and passions. Unfortunately, I don't have much time to work on them, but I try to do it whenever I can.

Currently, on my list of projects to do, there are:
+ [**guesscapitals.com**](https://www.guesscapitals.com): a web app to learn the capitals of the world. (Work in progress)
+ [**tarantino.world**](https://tarantino.world): a software project to analyze Tarantino's movies. (Work in progress)
+ [**books.tips**](https://books.tips): a book recommendation system. (Work in progress)


## Space Exploration 🚀

I have always been fascinated by space and everything about it. I keep up with the latest space exploration missions and discoveries. I follow SpaceX, NASA and the European Space Agency to stay informed of new satellites, rovers, and astronaut flights. I love seeing amazing photographs from space and learning about the mysteries of our solar system and the universe. I am especially interested in the search for extraterrestrial life and the possibility of colonizing other planets. 

I like to read papers and articles about future theories and technologies like the Dyson sphere, generation ships and planet terraforming. I am also interested in the ethical implications and the social impact of these technologies.
I am excited to see what the future holds for space exploration and **humanity's place in the universe**.

## Movies 🎥

I am an avid movie lover, especially those with an intriguing plot that makes me think. I especially enjoy the darkly comedic films of Quentin Tarantino with complex characters and intertwining storylines. Some of my favorites are **Pulp Fiction** (there is an easter egg in this website 😉 ), The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill and Django Unchained. I enjoy analyzing Tarantino's unconventional movie structure, intense dialogues and choice of music.

I had the idea of creating a **software project** that analyzes Tarantino's movies and extracts interesting information from them. For example, I would like to create a graph of the characters and their relationships in each movie, since they are often **connected** in surprising ways.
I would also like to analyze the dialogues and create some visualizations of the most used words and phrases. I think this would be a fun project to work on and a great way to learn more about data analysis and visualization, which is a field I am interested in.
This project is on my list of things to do in the future and when it is ready, it will be published on [tarantino.world](https://tarantino.world).

Beyond Tarantino, I appreciate movies like Inception, The Matrix, Blade Runner and Interstellar that explore the nature of reality and the human mind. I also enjoy watching **documentaries** about space, science, and history. I find it fascinating to learn about the world around us and the people who have shaped it.

## Italian Mysteries 🕵️

I delve into the most intriguing unsolved mysteries in Italian history like the Monster of Florence, the P2 Masonic Lodge and the Vatican Bank Scandal.
I am fascinated by these mysteries because they are so complex and involve so many different people and organizations like a big distributed system to be analyzed.

I like to read articles and blog posts and watch documentaries about these mysteries to learn more about them like the series "Blu notte - Misteri italiani" by Carlo Lucarelli.
I enjoy the books of Gianluigi Nuzzi which uncover sinister conspiracies within the Vatican through secret document leaks...

The general rule is: the more the mystery is complex, the more I like it and the more I want to dig into it.

The twists and turns of the investigations remind me of the importance of critical thinking, open-mindedness and persistence in problem-solving - skills relevant both to studying and analyzing Italian mysteries and tackling the technical challenges of working in the software industry.
The comparison might seem a bit far-fetched, but I think it's a good way to train my mind to think outside the box and to be open to **new ideas and perspectives**.

## Geography 🌍

Since I was in elementary school, Geography has been one of my favorite subjects. 
In particular, I like to learn about some of the most remote and isolated places on Earth like the Pitcairn Islands, Tristan da Cunha and the Kerguelen Islands. 
 
At 10 years old I knew almost all the capitals of the world and I was able to locate all the countries on the map. I was very proud of this achievement and I showed it to my parents and friends. 

Unfortunately, I have forgotten most of the capitals. Therefore, I am currently building a **web app** to help me learn them again and improve some technical skills in the process. When it is ready, it will be published on [guesscapitals.com](https://guesscapitals.com).

## Sports ⚽

I have always been a sports fan. I like to watch football, volleyball and Formula 1. I used to play football when I was younger and sometimes I still play with my friends. 

Today I'm approaching to running.

Those are just a few of my passions outside of university and work. I find that following my hobbies keeps me learning, curious and engaged with the world.
