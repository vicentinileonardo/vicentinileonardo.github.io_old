Hi! I am Leonardo Vicentini, Computer Science master's degree student and software engineer.

I am currently working on my master thesis on the topic of "Architectural analysis and design of a Kubernetes‑based SaaS".

My research interests include **cloud computing**, **distributed systems**, and **software engineering** in general.
