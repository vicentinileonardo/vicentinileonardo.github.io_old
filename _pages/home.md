Hi! I am Leonardo Vicentini, a master student in Computer Science at the University of Trento. I am currently working on my master thesis on the topic of "Architectural analysis and design of a Kubernetesâ€‘based SaaS".
My research interests include cloud computing, distributed systems, and software engineering in general.
